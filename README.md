# E-Portfolio
--------
The master branch contains 2 Jupyter Notebooks: <br>
E_Portfolio_Cats_vs_Dogs.ipynb is the Version we will work on. <br>
E_Portfolio_Cats_vs_Dogs_Complete.ipynb is the finshed Version with all Code implemented. <br>
There are no seperat Slides, because Jupyter Notebooks are great ! <br>
I would recommend to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the Notebooks. <br>
You can open the Notebooks directly from Colab if you import from Git and search for my Username Rico2000.

I would recommend to run the imports before the E-Portfolio. So everything should work fine.
